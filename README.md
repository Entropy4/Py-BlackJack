# Py_BlackJack
This is an Intermediate-Level Python program for an (almost) fully-fledged BlackJack game with heavy focus on OOP and Functions.

# Rules of the Game
    
1. The rules are pretty much the same as regular BlackJack except for the absence of:  
   - **Split  
   - **Surrender      
   - **Insurance
   - other side bets
   
2. You can play this game on your own against a computerised dealer or along with upto 3 other local friends!  
3. This particular BlackJack 'Table' follows **S17 Rule** i.e. if you have a hand with a total value of 17, you have the option to choose to stand.  
4. You start out with 1000 Chips in your hand. Place bets wisely or risk losing all Chips and getting kicked out.
